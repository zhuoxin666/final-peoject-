	<p>MP100 | FINAL PROJECT STATEMENT

Title: Final Project
Semester/Year:2020 fall semester
Software: Stop motion, Audacity

Description (200 words  giving the person listening to your work insight into your creative and technical process. For example: What was the artistic inspiration for this project? How did you make it your own? What format did you choose to make it in (music video, animation short, pseudo documentary)? What is your video about? What media techniques did you use? How did it change from your Storyboard conception to finish?


This sound is the main voice because the sound of sharks and birds is not what I like. The final cheer was to express joy because he tried successfully. If you use stop motion to make it, the picture is not so detailed, because it will be difficult for me to draw with my mobile phone. Combining music and animation is also a very interesting part of this project. This work mainly wants to express the spirit of success without giving up. The most difficult part is how to change each plot so that the picture is not too boring. The subject of the final project is also in line with my role positioning. Get close to nature and work hard to achieve your goals. There is still a little difference between the plot concept and the finished product, because of the difficulties in production. But I think most of the plot is shown.
